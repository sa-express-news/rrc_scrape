An attempt to formalize a set of scripts that scrape the Texas Railroad Commission's Website to gather data on natural gas flaring in Texas and, specifically, the Eagle Ford Shale play.  

These scripts originally generated some of the numbers used in the [Up In Flames](http://www.expressnews.com/business/eagleford/item/Up-in-Flames-Day-1-Flares-in-Eagle-Ford-Shale-32626.php) project, published in August 2014.
